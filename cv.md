I’m getting better day after day. That is the main reason why I’ve decided to try something new (rs school). I hope my diligence and the courses will help me to obtain useful knowledges.

### Skills:
JS
HTML&CSS
Git
Figma
Photoshop

### Code example
function truncate(str, maxlength) {
  let newStr;
  if (str.length > maxlength) {
 newStr = str.slice(0, maxlength - 3) + "...";
 return newStr;
  }
  return str;
}
